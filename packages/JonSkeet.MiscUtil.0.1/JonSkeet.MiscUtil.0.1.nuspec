    <description>MiscUtil is an "odds and ends" library with various utilities I've collected over the years. Note that this version is a pre-release containing the code which has been languishing for some time; before 1.0 is released as a NuGet package, it's likely that the namespace and signing key may change, and some classes may be redesigned or removed.</description>
